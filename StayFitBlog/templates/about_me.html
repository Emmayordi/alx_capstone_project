    <h2>Inspiration for StayFitBlog</h2>
    <p>
      The inspiration behind StayFitBlog stems from a deep-rooted desire to raise awareness <br>
       about two important health issues: postpartum depression and lupus. In my observation, <br>
        I’ve noticed a significant lack of awareness and understanding surrounding these conditions, <br>
        particularly in my home country. Many women suffer silently from postpartum depression,<br>
         often without realizing they are experiencing it. Similarly, my personal experience with my <br>
          sister’s battle with lupus revealed a startling lack of knowledge about this disease, <br>
           even among medical professionals.

    <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
    <p>
      StayFitBlog is more than just a blog; it’s a platform dedicated to spreading awareness, <br>
       sharing knowledge, and providing support to those affected by postpartum depression and <br>
        lupus. My goal is to empower individuals with information about these conditions  <br>
       and promote a healthy lifestyle through education and awareness. By sharing insights <br>
        and resources, I hope to create a community where individuals can find support, <br>
         encouragement, and inspiration to lead healthier lives.
